      <p>When I first met Ryder it was through a last minute booking to
open his show in a music lounge above a sports bar in Denver. All
I knew about him was faint rumors about a road hardened, Volvo
drivin’ divorcee from France who had a beautiful songbook. I’d
heard he was a doorman and a arborist and lived in Arkansas for a
spell, and self released his art without taking money from goddamn
anyone, an lived in a station wagon and had an open heart.</p>
      <br>

      <p>When I turned up at the venue it was late afternoon. There was a
taxidermy Leopard on the wall and a pool table pushed to the side
of the room. I found Ryder pacing the checkered dance floor,
taking a measure, wearing work pants, a stained singlet and a
beret type of hat. He had curly hair an long eyelashes lit up in a
sunbeam shining from a dusty window. He looked skinny, but he was
broad in the shoulders, an I know some skinny fellers can be very
hard to knock down indeed. He introduced himself politely and
invited me to the greenroom to drink soda water, and there I met
his Mexican violinist and one-person band. Her name was Paola Zam,
an when Ryder went out to get changed she told me that they’d been
pulled over that day by highway patrolmen, in Kansas, and that
Ryder had refused them to search the rental car on principle, and
held his nerve. That really said something to me. It’s rare in the
music game to find a real son of a bitch who’ll stand ground about
their ethos when pushed.</p>
      <br>

      <p>When Ryder and Paola took the stage it was in front of about a
dozen people. Ryder’d donned an outfit like a mixture of a
mariachi musician, a chaplain and a sailor. An I wasn’t prepared
for his show. Not at all. An nor was the crowd, who seemed to have
come up from the sports bar on a whim and didn’t know who Ryder
was either. There was a wild static in the room, a nervousness you
get when someone wears sailor pants and stares at you from a
stage. But when Ryder and Paola began to perform, immediately it
was like they rang a bell in the depth of our souls. He’s got the
knack of bringing folks in and making em feel like everything’s
alright. His voice was so heartbroken, the songs so melodic. The
poetry was true and deeply personal, exposing Ryder’s feelings and
heartache, and as he poured out his heart he also shed his clothes
to the floor. Time moved fast. It was a party, but with a feeling
of sick voyeurism, like we were partaking in something illicit,
peering where we had no right to. Ryder leapt from the stage and
stood on a table, then waltzed among the crowd. He dragged the mic
chord like a chain and had us all captivated. At the finale the
room exploded in applause as Ryder collapsed against the stage,
sweaty and exhausted. A guy in the crowd wearing an NBA jersey
over a t-shirt told me his life was changed from then on. He could
barely believe what he’d seen. His wife was aglow, laughing, and
said she couldn’t put words to it either. An I agreed. It’s hard
to describe the significance of a show like that. It’s hard to
write poetry then make music that sounds like the lyrics it’s
about, and then to embody that music on the stage and be that
entertaining about it. It’s like a piece of driftwood that was hit
by lightening and engraved with words to give it strange powers.
You don’t just read or see or hear it. It’s an occurrence.</p>
      <br>

      <p>An look, I been all over the world playin’ shows. I seen all kinds
of bullshit on stage and off. It’s tough to find artists who
aren’t just floggin mutton on a auction block or tryin to
rainmake, or just decipherers of the next big sound. When I drove
home that night I cracked the sunroof in my Lexus and played
“Autotango” on CD, and had what I’d describe as a healing
experience. The songs are about dark things that are hard to
grasp. Regret and irreversible failures. Depression. Questions
about being yourself. Heartbreaks of different types. Ryder’s
lyrical eyepiece shifts to different specters that are normally
too frightening to confront. But the songs are so jacked up, so
driven and cool and badass that they grant you special strength
and swagger. And they’re imbued with humor and sweetness and
gentleness that ordains you the right to be tender and forgiving
of yourself. I went back through his earlier records, “Megachurch”
and “Follymoon”, and found a ream of this type a writing. Deep,
dark thoughts made cool and light. Sweet release. Cathartic music
you can drive a 25 year old sedan in. One handing round corners.
Feeling cool and pumped up, and healed and released about stuff in
your life.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Ryder and Paola needed a place to stay in Denver that night, and
my friend Parsons offered them a room. The next morning Ryder and
I shared some coffee and talked about music and the road, luck,
day jobs, losing, love. The man is a mad guru, a street genius.
Since then I kept in touch, and was lucky to receive an early
listen to his next record. It’s called “Smile, Hearse Driver!” and
I gotta say, no bullshit, it’s my favorite of his records yet. The
specter of death is on the horizon for Ryder. The songs are super
powerful. If you are a show booker I hereby recommend booking
Ryder The Eagle for shows. If you’re a lover of artistry and great
music and real things, tune in. If you’re a fan, count me among
you forever.</p>
